# Basic Refrigeration System

This is a simple code for Arduino.

I did this while studying the components of arduino and how it work. Here you will find the code and the circuit image to build it and make it work

1. Plug all the components like in the image above
    (image)
2. Copy and paste the .ino code to your arduino IDE
3. Upload the code to your arduino and be happy

__Be careful when connecting the parts to not harm tyour precious arduino__
